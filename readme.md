# Introduction:

Infamously known as 'Chiraq', Chicago's reputation as a violent, crime-infested city precedes it. But is crime in Chicago truly that concerning? This project explores crime in Chicago by analyzing crime statistics to understand crime trends in Chicago. Concurrently, we explore any effects that crime rates and violence in Chicago can have on the state of education and the behaviors of students in Chicago Public Schools.

The following research questions guided our capstone project: 

  1. Has crime in Chicago increased or decreased over the last decade?
  2. How has crime in Chicago affected education and students?
  3. Do students feel safe in Chicago public schools?
  4. Is there a correlation between reported crime in Chicago and behavorial issues (misconduct, suspensions, etc.) within the Chicago Public Schools?
  5. What effect has crime in Chicago had on the safety, academic performance, and behavior of students?
  6. Are graduation rates at Chicago schools affected by crime in those areas?
  7. Are there any connections between the school students' demographics and the reported misconducts?
